    <p>Winky was named after that one house elf from Harry Potter that the movies completely forgot about. She loved parsley, Martin's apple chips, and basking in the sun. She was a model for professional easter-themed photoshoots as THE Easter bunny! I'll never forget her big dulap (the name for the large fat around her neck,) and her cute little white nose. </p>
