    <p>Hugo was one of two bunny's that my family adopted in 2011. He was a little Holland lop, with floppy ears and big fluffy feet. My mom named him Hugo actually because his feet were huge, and since he was a Holland lop, he deserved a Dutch name. He loved to harass his brother, but was very cuddly with anyone who picked him up.</p>
