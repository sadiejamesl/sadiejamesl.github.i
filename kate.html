    <p>Kate was found under our front step one summer, skinny and cold. My mom, a kind, animal loving soul, started feeding her from the front step, and slowly but surely, Kate learned to trust us. We brought her to the humane society, as she was obviously unhomed, but she was very angry with anyone who wasn't my mom. The vets said there were many health complications with her, and so, we decided to foster her for a while during the final portions of her life. While our time with her was short lived, I will always be happy knowing that this sweet little kitty lived a comfortable final few months. </p>
